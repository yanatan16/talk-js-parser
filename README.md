Talk given at BoulderJS Meetup on February 17, 2015

## Outline

Framed as a story about my dog, Tyson.

Tyson wants to parse a new language, but doesn't know where to start. So we introduced parser combinators. We start small, but then grow to parse a small lisp. Tyson becomes free to parse his dream language.
